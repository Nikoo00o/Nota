/// Used for easy comparison for immutable objects that only have final member variables which should be included in the
/// comparison. They will be passed to the constructor as a map with descriptions and they will be used with the
/// [properties] getter in the [props] getter which is then used for comparison.
///
/// This class overrides the operator== to not compare references, but the properties list instead!
///
/// Important: If the sub class has non-final members that can change and should be used for comparison, then you have to
/// override the [props], or [properties] getter and always return a new list of member variables which will be used,
/// because otherwise the changed data will not be used for comparison!
///
/// But: don't use mutable classes with non final fields for hash collections (for example map keys)!!!
///
/// If you have nested sub classes, then they either need to combine all properties maps together in the constructor, so
/// the final map includes all member variables, or you only use the properties map in the top most class to provide the
/// most member variables and then in sub classes you override the [props], or [properties] getter and add the remaining
/// members to the call of the getter of the super class.
///
/// Best practice is to always make sub classes of this class immutable with only final members and then provide a
/// copyWith function that returns a new object with modified members from the parameters!
/// If that function is used in a subclass, then all deeper sub classes should implement the method again. And if the same
/// parameters are used for example inside of a model for an entity, then it is a valid override for the method of the
/// entity and can also be called with an entity reference.
