# Nota Todos 

- application id changed, so careful with reinstall! 
- add multiple note types also with reminders, or maybe a password manager file that needs a password (or biometrics)
  to unlock and displays a list 
  - password manager would have a toggle for hide/show with lock icon and an option to copy the fields
- maybe add a share feature to share notes (and also receive them with an intent) with share_plus. and that option 
  should also be included in the top right menu (default txt notes should be shared as string text, but other file 
  wrapper should be shared as files!)
  - also sending files to other users and making backups, or showing a edit history would be good! 
  - also pdf view with temp file export from the file wrapper should work (and maybe also videos?)
- add multi select with long press on notes in the selection (for delete, move) 
- also make blocs cleaner and leaner and maybe make some shared base classes

## New Features 

- implement the todos from the old todo file like freedrawing, markdown support, rich text editor, maybe audio, etc 
  and better desktop support. also shared notes and maybe also include calendar and timers and pictures within the 
  note folder structure
- also backup, export, etc 
- maybe also add a toolbar down above the keyboard for text size, color and also an undo button for the current 
  changes? 
- also add local config option to auto sync on each login and after each save?
- new: extended search should open focused default search inside of a node when opening a node with the same text 
  selected
- improve startup to not depend on local stored data and instead use default values and query the data later and 
  then also handle if the app is already open on desktop 
- new note type: user/person with name + address easy searchable, or auto extended search, or auto save on login and 
  exit note
