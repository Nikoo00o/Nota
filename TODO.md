# Nota Todos 

- add multiple note types also with reminders, or maybe a password manager file that needs a password to unlock and 
  displays a list 
- maybe add a share feature to share notes (and also receive them with an intent) with share_plus. and that option 
  should also be included in the top right menu 
  - also sending files to other users and making backups, or showing a edit history would be good! 
- add multi select with long press on notes in the selection (for delete, move) 
- also make blocs cleaner and leaner and maybe make some shared base classes

## New Features 

- implement the todos from the old todo file like freedrawing, markdown support, rich text editor, maybe audio, etc 
  and better desktop support. also shared notes and maybe also include calendar and timers 
- also backup, export, etc
